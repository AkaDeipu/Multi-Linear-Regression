Data Importing and Preprocessing: Loading the dataset and handling duplicates.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data distribution with descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Model Building: Constructing and evaluating the regression model, which includes analyzing the VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) to check for multicollinearity.
